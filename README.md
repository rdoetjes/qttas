QTTas stands for Qt Tool Assisted Speedrun.
It's a tutorial on how to start setting up a quick and asynchornous screenshit based TAS or TAG.

URL to play the game we are controlling: http://bdrgames.nl/lcdgames/games/highway/index.html
NOTICE: You would need to set the matrices with X, Y coordinates for your own screen/browser size; this is a demonstration only

-We will discuss getting a screen shot.
-Reading absolute pixels (the code for demonstration purposes is kept simple and has no relative pixel locations)
-Making a simple decision logic to avoid the obstacles in the game
